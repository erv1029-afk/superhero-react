🚀 Technologies Used
• 	React: Component-based UI architecture
• 	Context API + useReducer: Global state management for hero data and loading/error states
• 	SuperHero API: External RESTful API for character data
• 	Vite: Fast build tool for modern React apps
• 	Netlify: Deployment platform with Git integration
• 	CSS (Global): Comic-style layout and typography using  font and dramatic accents

🧠 Approach
This app was built with modularity, clarity, and storytelling in mind:
• 	Context-first architecture: Centralized state using  and  for clean data flow
• 	Component isolation: Each UI piece (SearchBar, HeroList, Loader, Error) is self-contained and expressive
• 	Progressive enhancement: Started with core functionality, then layered in styling and UX polish
• 	Learner-friendly logic: Annotated reducer actions and fetch flows for future developer
